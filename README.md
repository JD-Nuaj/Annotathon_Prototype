# Annotathon V2 - Prototype

Welcome to the Annotathon prototype, a collaborative bioinformatics platform for annotating metagenomic DNA fragments. This project was designed to demonstrate my developer skills through a functional and modern MVP, using modern technologies suitable for rapid prototyping.

# Technologies Used

<Backend: Ruby on Rails 7.2>
Why Ruby on Rails? Because it’s a mature, quick-to-implement technology that’s perfectly suited for prototypes. As a Ruby developer, this choice allows me to deliver a functional prototype in a short amount of time. Rails provides a clear structure for rapid development and feature integration, making it ideal for an MVP. Additionally, it integrates directly with features like user management, authorization, and relational databases, eliminating the need for additional tool configuration.

<Frontend: Stimulus.js>
Why Stimulus.js? Stimulus is a lightweight, modern JavaScript framework that integrates seamlessly with Ruby on Rails. It allows for dynamic page behavior without the complexity of a heavy JavaScript framework. Since this prototype is focused on a simpler interface with basic interactions, Stimulus.js is ideal for adding JavaScript functionality without overcomplicating the architecture. It works well with Rails and avoids the overhead of using a framework like Vue.js for an MVP.

<Database: PostgreSQL>
Why PostgreSQL? It's a robust, reliable relational database that’s ideal for managing complex data like users, teams, and annotations. It integrates smoothly with Rails, ensuring a seamless connection between the data model and SQL queries.

<CSS: Tailwind CSS>
Why Tailwind? Because it allows me to quickly build modern, responsive interfaces without spending time writing custom CSS. Its utility-first approach enables fast customization without complexity.

# Why These Technologies?

This prototype is designed to demonstrate my ability to build a solid and well-structured application, but it’s just a first step. The goal isn’t to build the final product but to create a solid foundation on which the site can be improved and extended. Using Ruby on Rails for the backend and Stimulus.js for the frontend allows for rapid, lightweight development—ideal for a functional prototype without too much complexity. Stimulus.js integrates well with Rails, adding dynamic behavior to the interface without the need for a full-fledged SPA with Vue.js.

PHP/Laravel and Vue.js will be the technologies used for the final version of Annotathon, as they offer more flexibility, scalability, and a better architecture for a large production application. However, for a prototype, Rails and Stimulus.js are more than sufficient and effective.

# Open-Source and Education

The Annotathon project is open-source, which aligns perfectly with my values. As an open-source enthusiast, I firmly believe in collaboration, transparency, and the sharing of knowledge. This approach fits well with the collaborative spirit of Annotathon, which allows scientists and students to contribute to a large-scale bioinformatics project.

My passion for education and science naturally led me to get involved in this project. The Annotathon platform is a valuable resource for the scientific community, and I am confident that modernizing it will help make powerful, intuitive tools more accessible for scientific research.

# About Me

I was born in Marseille, by the sea. The sea is part of who I am, and I have always been sensitive to ecological issues, particularly the protection of our oceans and seas. This affinity with the environment is also reflected in my work, where I strive to provide meaningful solutions while contributing to science and education.

This prototype is a step toward a more ambitious V2, but above all, its purpose is to prove that I am capable of designing, developing, and delivering a functional and well-structured application. I hope this project showcases my technical skills and my passion for technology and science.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this prototype. I look forward to discussing the future of Annotathon and what we can achieve together.
